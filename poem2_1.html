  <br><br><body>
    <br><br>

    <p><center>My mouth blooms like a cut.
      <br>I've been wronged all year, <br><br>tedious
      <br><br>nights,<br><br>nothing but rough elbows in them
      <br>and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling <br><br>crybaby, crybaby,
      <br><br> you fool!</center></p>

<div class="title" id="font1">
    <p><center> <br><br>Befeore today my body was useless.
      <br>Now it's tearing at its square corners.
      <br> It's tearing old Mary's garments off
</div>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>knot by knot
      <br><br>and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts. <br><br> <em>ZING! A RESURRECTION</em> </center></p>
    <p><center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once it was a boat, quite wooden
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with no business, no salt under it
      <br>and in need of some paint. <br><br>It was no more than a group of boards.
      <br><br>But you hoisted her, <br><br>rigged her. <br> <br>She's been elected. </center></p>
    <p><center> My nerves are turned on.
      <br>I hear them like musical intruments. <br>Where there was a silence

the drums, the strings
<br>are incurably playing. <br><br>You did this.
<br>Pure genius at work. <br><br>Darling, the composer has stepped into fire. </center></p>
