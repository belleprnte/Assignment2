  <body>
    <p>My <br>mouth <br>blooms <br>like <br>a<br>cut.
      <br><br>I've been wrong all year,
      <br>tedious nights,
      <br>nothing but rough elbows in them
      <br>and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling <br><br>CRYBABY
      <br>CRYBABY,<br>YOU FOOL!</p>
    <p>Before today my body was useless.
      <br>Now it's tearing at its square corners.
      <br>It's tearing old Mary's garments off,
      <br>knot <br>by <br>knot
      <br>and see-- Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.
      <br>ZING! <br>A resurrection!</p>
    <p>Once it was a boat, <br>quite wooden
      <br>and with no business,
      <br>no salt water under it
      <br>and in need of some paint.
       <br>It was no more than a group of boards. But you hoisted her,
       <br>rigged her. <br>She's been elected. </p>
    <p>My <br>nerves <br>are <br>turned <br>on.
      <br>I hear them like musical instruments.
      <br>Where there was silence <br>the drums,
      <br>the strings are incurably playing.
       <br>You did this. <br>Pure genius at work.
        <br>Darling the composer <br>has
      stepped into fire.</p>
