  <br><br><br><br><br><br><p>My mouth blooms like a cut.
    <br><br><center>I've been wrong all year, tedious</center>
    <br><br>nights,nothing but rough elbows in them
    <br><br><center>and delicate boxes of Kleenex calling crybaby
    </center><br><br>crybaby, you fool!</p>
  <br><br><p>Before today my body was useless.
    <br><br><center>Now it's tearing at its square corners.
    </center><br><br>It's tearing old Mary's garments off, knot by knot
    <br><br><center>and see--Now it's shot full of these electric bolts.
    </center> <br><br>Zing! A resurrection!</p>
  <br><br><p>Once it was a boat, quite wooden
    <br><br><center> and with no business, no salt water under it</center>
    <br><br>and in need of some paint. It was no more
    <br><br><center>than a group of boards, But you hoisted her, rigged her.
    </center> <br><br>She's been elected.</p>
  <br><br><p>My nerves are turned on. I hear them like
    <br><br><center> musical intruments. Where there was a silence
    </center> <br><br>the drums, the strings are incurably playing. You did this.
    <br><br><center> Pure genius at work. Darling the composer has stepped</center>
    <br><br>into fire.</p>
